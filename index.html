        <h3>Geneseo Digital Humanities Research Group</h3>
        <h6>The Geneseo Digital Humanities (GDH) Research Group serves to promote the study of the intersection of quantitative and digital research methods, social sciences, and the humanities. Focusing on areas as broad as computational linguistics or network models of literature, the GDH Research Group instructs students on how to navigate the growing and increasingly difficult navigate field through hands-on-learning projects that pair students with mentors and supervisors that will introduce them to concepts and techniques outside of the students’ given fields. In turn, the GDH Research Group will be able to help assist faculty across a variety of departments conduct cutting edge research, while also contributing to their own portfolio, especially through the production of original research papers and presentations. Ultimately, the GDH Research Group serves to bring Geneseo to the forefront of burgeoning field that is in desperate need for leadership, especially at the undergraduate level. In conducting high caliber research, the GDH Research Group will continually establish itself as a national leader in the training and preparation of undergraduate scholars in the Digital Humanities.</h6>
